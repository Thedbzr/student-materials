# Buisness Requirements: Operation RNDR

## Executive Summary

Our Client ActionLabs has asked us to plan a project to develop a native gaming app. This gaming app will be a first-person-shooter(fps) with the title of Operation RNDR(short for Render). This app will allow players to render their live location and use it as an in game rendered map. Not only with capabilities to render their live locations using gps locating but also add to the maps via in-game map content creator and editor.This Document will explain the scope,deliver schedule,personal requierments to meet deadlines of the project, as well as the functional requirments needed to satisfy the client needs.

## Business Objectives

This project is of extreme importance. It will be the first of its kind. A gps based, vitrual rendering first-person-shooter.
This will usher in the next level of immersive gameplay in the fps genre.Not only will it connect players around the world via the internet but it will create a social enviornment where players must meet up in live locations to play the game.
The goal is to meet the required functionalities for the release of a beta verion that will go live for the purpouse of data collection.

## Background

The Client is initiating this project for the sole purpouse of evolving the bland and played out cookie cuter fps games that have not changed in the past decade.The want to bring something new the market that will revive the fps genre.

## Scope

The project will start once the team has analysed the tasks needed to fullfill the required functionality , you will provide a minimal project managment documentation explaining: estimates, list of risk, a milestone chart. Based on those we will be able to agree on the final scope and final date for the project.

-Contraints: 
  - App should be released in time for IOS 13
  - Sams Vacation has a fixed start day - July 12
  
-Exclusions:
  - IOS 13 new feature support
  - UI/UX Changes related to IOS 13 

## Functional requirements

1.They would like players to be able to log in create unique profiles and connect with other players via audio and chat.

2.View a list of others ranking in leaderboard, view stats (K/D ratio,Assists,Medals,Role(ie:Sniper,Heavy Gunner,Smg Specialist,..))

3.Also with the integration of Gps Location be able to find local players in their areas and their in-game stats.

4.They would like a list of optional playable roles in game.

 - Smg Class - Runs really fast, usually weak in terms of health/armor, weaponry is fast-firing and only good at close range. weapons: smgs

 - Assault Class - medium of offensive and defensive power. They usually can't run the fastest in the game, but they also don't run the slowest. Their health/armor isn't the highest, but it's not the lowest. Their gun can definitely kill, but it is usually different in some way from the very light and very heavy classes. It the average class. weapon: Assault Rifles

 - Heavy, Slow Tanky Class - Runs very slow but has a lot of health very tanky, and a high-firepower gun. Difficult to take out head-on. Weapon: Heavy Machine Guns/Light Machine Guns

 - Sniper Class - Has high-firepower, long-range weapon, but is generally weak up close. weapons: high caliber sniper rifles.

 - Healer Class - Heals up teammates, weakness is the inability to sustain itself in combat.

 - Area Denial Class - This class will shoot projectiles to push people out of a areas.They will have lower weapon accuracy but high explosive damage. They will be equiped with rocket launchers,granades, and other explosives.

 - Melee Class - have very limited use of, ranged weaponry. To balance this natural disadvantage, theyll have additional resistance to damage and be able to close distance between them and the enmey quickly..They will run with melee based weapons knifes, crossbows.

 - Sneaky Class - be able to go invisible or teleport to go behind enemy lines and pick them off from behind. Weapons: smgs/melees/trap explosives.

5. Use Google Street satelite and street View in conjuction with Gps location to render the locations in game.

6. team balancing functionality based on stats of players within the match.

## Personnel requirements

In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.

Dedicated Development Teams: 
  - Rendering and Gps : 15people
  - Design and Art: 10 people
  - UI/UX Functions: 5people
  
  
 !Required Video Game Programmer Expert in Fps and Online MultiplayerÂ¡

## Other requirements

The Client Values Online Connection and Community so any featuers that would help connect players would be welcome. Theres is also a level of value for inovation so interactivity with real world rendered objects would be a plus. IE: if thers a gas station rendered in-game then letting it explode when shot at would be nice user interactivity.
The Client dose have a sense of responsibility in setting the bar as its the first of its kind game. They would like all holy areas (churchs) and school to be deamed as unplayable as a map.

## Assumptions

Google Maps API will be necessary.
Use of Native Gps Locations will be necessary as well.

## Limitations

The Project is quite large so if needed cost and scope of the project can be opened for discussion if an extentsion is needed.

## Risks

- High Risk:
  - The inability to get the required functionality of rendering the live location to in game would make this app a failure.
